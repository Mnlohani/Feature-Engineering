What is feature Engineering
a process of transforming data into features to better represent the underlying problem and enhancing ML performance.

A feature is an attribute of data that is meaningful to the machine learning process

####
Steps to feature enginerring: overview

1. Obtain a baseline performance of the machine learning model before applying
any feature engineering procedures

2. Apply feature engineering procedures

3. For each application of feature engineering, obtain a performance measure and
compare it to our baseline performance

4. if change in performance precedes a threshold, apply into ML pipeline

5. This change in performance will usually be measured as a percentage (if the baseline went from 40% accuracy to 76% accuracy, that is a 90% improvement)

####
Baseline for evaluating ML pipeline performnce:

Evaluating supervised learning algorithms:

#for classification

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
X = some_data_in_tabular_format
y = response_variable
lr = LinearRegression()
scores = cross_val_score(lr, X, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')

#For regression

from sklearn.linear-model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
X = some_data_in_tabular_format
y = response_variable
lr = LinearRegression()
scores = cross_val_score(lr, X, y, cv=5, scoring='mean_squared_error')

#Evaluating unsupervised learning algorithms:

we will usually utilize the silhouette coefficient (a measure of
separation and cohesion of clusters between -1 and 1)

attributes = tabular_data
cluster_labels = outputted_labels_from_clustering
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
silhouette_score(attributes, cluster_labels)
